By doing so, the student model can generalize better and perform similarly to the teacher model, but with reduced computational resources and memory requirements. Model distillation is particularly useful when deploying models on resource-constrained devices like mobile phones or embedded systems."

    "34. **Data Augmentation Techniques in CNNs and Addressing Limited Training Data:**\n",
    "   - **Rotation and Flipping:** Randomly rotating or flipping images can increase the diversity of training data and make the model more invariant to orientation.\n",
    "   - **Scaling and Cropping:** Random scaling and cropping can introduce variations in object sizes and positions, helping the model handle objects at different scales.\n",
    "   - **Translation:** Shifting images horizontally or vertically can introduce position variations, making the model more robust to object placements.\n",
    "   - **Color Jittering:** Applying random changes to color components (brightness, contrast, saturation) can make the model more tolerant to color variations.\n",
    "   - **Cutout:** Randomly masking out regions of the image can simulate occlusion and improve the model's ability to handle occluded objects.\n",

    "35. **Class Imbalance in CNN Classification Tasks and Techniques for Handling it:**\n",
    "   - **Class Weighting:** Assigning higher weights to samples from the minority class during training can balance the impact of class imbalance.\n",
    "   - **Over-sampling:** Duplicating samples from the minority class to balance the class distribution can help improve performance but may cause overfitting.\n",
    "   - **Under-sampling:** Removing some samples from the majority class to balance the class distribution, but this may lead to loss of information.\n",
    "   - **Synthetic Data Generation:** Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) can create synthetic samples for the minority class, improving its representation.\n",
    "   - **Ensemble Methods:** Using ensemble techniques like bagging and boosting can improve the model's ability to handle class imbalance.\n",
    "   - **Metrics Selection:** Focusing on evaluation metrics like F1-score, precision-recall curve, and area under the curve (AUC) that are suitable for imbalanced datasets.\n",

    "36. **Application of Self-supervised Learning in CNNs for Unsupervised Feature Learning:**\n",
    "   Self-supervised learning is a type of unsupervised learning that leverages the inherent structure in the data to create pseudo-labels for training without the need for manual annotations. In CNNs, self-supervised learning is applied to learn useful feature representations from unlabeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Common techniques used in self-supervised learning for CNNs include:\n",
    "   - **Autoencoders:** Autoencoders learn to encode an input image into a compact representation and then decode it back to the original image. The objective is to minimize the reconstruction error.\n",
    "   - **Contrastive Learning:** The model learns to maximize the similarity between differently augmented versions of the same image (positive samples) while minimizing the similarity between images from different classes (negative samples).\n",
    "   - **Predicting Image Patches:** The model is trained to predict the missing patch from an image with a randomly masked region.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Self-supervised learning can help CNNs learn meaningful and generalizable feature representations without relying on manual annotations, which is beneficial when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.\n",

    "37. **Popular CNN Architectures for Medical Image Analysis Tasks:**\n",
    "   Medical image analysis tasks often involve working with diverse and complex data, and several CNN architectures have been specifically designed for medical image processing. Some popular architectures include:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **U-Net:** Originally designed for medical image segmentation, U-Net has an encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections to maintain fine-grained spatial information.\n",
    "   - **VGG-16 and VGG-19:** VGG architectures are widely used as a base model for transfer learning in medical image analysis due to their simplicity and effectiveness.\n",
    "   - **ResNet (Residual Network):** ResNet's skip connections enable the training of deeper models without vanishing gradients, making it suitable for complex medical image tasks.\n",
    "   - **DenseNet:** DenseNet's dense connectivity helps propagate features effectively across layers, making it useful for tasks with limited data.\n",
